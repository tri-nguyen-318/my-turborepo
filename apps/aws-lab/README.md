## Lab 01 — S3 (Simple Storage Service)

**What is S3?** Object storage in the cloud — like a giant file system for any type of data.

**Run:** `yarn s3`

**What it does:**

| Step | Operation                          | What you'll see                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create a bucket                    | `✅ Bucket "my-learning-bucket" created`       |
| 2    | Upload 3 files (text + JSON)       | `✅ Uploaded hello.txt`                        |
| 3    | Download and read a file           | `📄 Content of hello.txt: "Hello from S3!..."` |
| 4    | List objects with prefix filtering | Files listed with size and timestamp           |
| 5    | Generate a presigned URL           | A temporary signed URL printed to console      |
| 6    | Delete everything                  | All objects and the bucket removed             |

**Key concepts learned:**

- **Bucket** — a container for files (must be globally unique)
- **Key** — the "path" to a file inside a bucket (e.g. `data/users.json`)
- **Presigned URL** — a temporary link to access a private file without credentials
- **Prefix filtering** — simulating folders by filtering keys that start with `data/`

## Lab 02 — DynamoDB

**What is DynamoDB?** A fully managed NoSQL key-value database, designed for massive scale.

**Run:** `yarn dynamodb`

**What it does:**

| Step | Operation                                | What you'll see                       |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create a table with partition + sort key | `✅ Table "Users" is ACTIVE`          |
| 2    | Insert 4 user items                      | `✅ Inserted: Tri (tri@example.com)`  |
| 3    | Get a single item by key                 | Full item printed with all attributes |
| 4    | Update an item's attributes              | Updated item with new age and role    |
| 5    | Query by partition key                   | All items for `user-1` (2 results)    |
| 6    | Scan with filter                         | All users with role `developer`       |
| 7    | Delete an item                           | `🗑️ Deleted user-3`                   |
| 8    | Delete the table                         | Table removed                         |

**Key concepts learned:**

- **Partition Key (PK)** — the main key to identify items (like a primary key)
- **Sort Key (SK)** — optional second key for ordering and range queries
- **Query vs Scan** — Query is fast (uses PK), Scan reads the whole table (expensive!)
- **UpdateExpression** — a mini-language to modify specific fields without replacing the whole item
- **DocumentClient** — a wrapper that lets you use plain JS objects instead of DynamoDB's verbose format

## Lab 03 — SQS (Simple Queue Service)

**What is SQS?** A message queue that decouples producers and consumers. One service sends messages, another processes them later.

**Run:** `yarn sqs`

**What it does:**

| Step | Operation                        | What you'll see                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create a queue                   | `✅ Queue created: http://...`               |
| 2    | Send a single message            | `✅ Message sent! ID: ...`                   |
| 3    | Send a batch of 3 messages       | `✅ Batch of 3 messages sent`                |
| 4    | Receive and inspect messages     | Message body, ID, and receipt handle printed |
| 5    | Delete messages after processing | `🗑️ Deleted message: ...`                    |
| 6    | Consumer loop (poll until empty) | `✅ Processed: ORDER_CREATED (ORD-002)`      |
| 7    | Delete the queue                 | Queue removed                                |

**Key concepts learned:**

- **Producer/Consumer pattern** — one service sends, another reads and processes
- **Visibility Timeout** — after reading, a message is hidden from other consumers; if not deleted, it reappears
- **Long Polling** — `WaitTimeSeconds` makes the consumer wait for messages instead of returning empty immediately
- **Delete after processing** — you must explicitly delete messages; this ensures at-least-once delivery
- **Batch operations** — send up to 10 messages in a single API call for efficiency

## Lab 04 — SNS (Simple Notification Service)

**What is SNS?** A pub/sub service. A publisher sends one message to a "topic", and SNS delivers copies to all subscribers.

**Run:** `yarn sns`

**What it does:**

| Step | Operation                              | What you'll see                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create an SNS topic                    | `✅ Topic created: arn:aws:sns:...`      |
| 2    | Create 2 SQS queues as subscribers     | `✅ Created queue: email-notifications`  |
| 3    | Subscribe both queues to the topic     | `✅ Email queue subscribed`              |
| 4    | Publish 2 events to the topic          | `✅ Published ORDER_CREATED event`       |
| 5    | Read from both queues — same messages! | Both queues show the same order events   |
| 6    | Cleanup                                | Topic, subscriptions, and queues deleted |

**Key concepts learned:**

- **Fan-out pattern** — 1 message → N subscribers (e.g., one order event triggers email + inventory + analytics)
- **SNS vs SQS** — SNS is push-based (one-to-many), SQS is pull-based (one-to-one)
- **SNS + SQS together** — the most common pattern: SNS fans out to multiple SQS queues, each processed independently
- **Topic/Subscription model** — publishers don't know about subscribers; adding a new consumer requires zero code changes to the publisher

## Lab 05 — Lambda

**What is Lambda?** Serverless compute — upload your code, AWS runs it on demand. No servers to manage.

**Run:** `yarn lambda`

**What it does:**

| Step | Operation                              | What you'll see                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create a function from code            | `✅ Function "my-hello-function" created`    |
| 2    | Get function details                   | Runtime, memory, timeout, handler info       |
| 3    | Invoke synchronously (wait for result) | `📄 Response: { message: "Hello, Tri!..." }` |
| 4    | Invoke with different payloads         | 3 different inputs → 3 different outputs     |
| 5    | List all functions                     | Functions listed with runtime and memory     |
| 6    | Invoke asynchronously (fire & forget)  | `📊 Status: 202 (accepted)`                  |
| 7    | Delete the function                    | Function removed                             |

**Key concepts learned:**

- **Handler** — the entry point function (`index.handler` = `index.js` file, `handler` export)
- **Synchronous vs Async invocation** — `RequestResponse` waits for result; `Event` returns immediately
- **Cold start** — first invocation is slower because Lambda needs to initialize a container
- **Event-driven** — in real AWS, Lambda is triggered by S3 uploads, SQS messages, API Gateway requests, scheduled cron, etc.
- **Pay-per-use** — you only pay for the time your code runs (no idle server costs)

## Learning Path

Run the labs in order — each builds on concepts from the previous one:

```
01-s3        → Storage basics (where your files live)
02-dynamodb  → Database basics (where your data lives)
03-sqs       → Messaging basics (how services talk to each other)
04-sns       → Pub/Sub + Fan-out (one event → many consumers, uses SQS from lab 03)
05-lambda    → Serverless compute (code that runs without servers)
```

## Troubleshooting

**LocalStack won't start:**

```bash
docker compose logs localstack  # Check logs for errors
docker compose down && docker compose up localstack -d  # Restart
```

**"Connection refused" errors:**

- Make sure LocalStack is running: `docker compose ps localstack`
- Check the health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health`

**Port 4566 already in use:**

```bash
lsof -i :4566  # Find what's using the port
```
